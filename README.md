# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation with Three.js

A realistic, interactive 3D model of the Solar System built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project simulates planetary orbits, moons, textures, and lighting using WebGL, offering an immersive learning or demonstration tool.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌞 Sun at the center with realistic texture
- 🪐 Planets with accurate relative sizes, distances, and orbits
- 🌙 Moons orbiting Earth and Mars
- 🌀 Orbital animation using trigonometric positioning
- 🖱️ Camera control with `OrbitControls`
- 🧊 Dynamic skybox using a cubemap texture background
- 💡 Ambient and point lighting for a space-like effect
